Disclaimer: This repo is heavily inspired by [ErickKS](https://github.com/ErickKS/pomodoro-timer) work.

This project is a customizable Pomodoro Timer built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application was heavily inspired by the work of [ErickKS](https://github.com/ErickKS/pomodoro-timer), and includes additional features such as an initial page for setting work and break intervals, and a vertical row to display the intervals. The application is a work in progress, with many additional features planned for future development.
