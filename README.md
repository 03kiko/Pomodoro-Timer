## What's next ?
The idea of this project is to add some functionalities to make *ErickKS* work more complete.
There is many more things to add so feel free to do a pull request!

## What I added:
- Initial page that allows users to customize their work and break intervals;
- Modified the timer function to work with the inputs;
- Add a vertical row to the work/break panel;

## What to add next:
- Input validation;
- Additional functionalities such as pause and resume buttons;
- Sound indicator when a interval ends;
- Music during the intervals, maybe be able to choose a music type in the initial page;
- Progress bar;
- Session count;
- Long and short brake times;
